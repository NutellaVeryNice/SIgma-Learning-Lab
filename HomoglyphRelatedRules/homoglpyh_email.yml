title: Suspicious Homoglyph Email Sender Domain Detected
id: 1cbeac47-fb8a-4c2e-b9f6-4d8cb192e3fa
status: experimental
description: Detects emails where the sender domain is a known homoglyph variation of a trusted domain 
(e.g. rnicrosoft.com instead of microsoft.com)
Intended to be used with a Splunk lookup table called 'homoglyph_domains.csv' for enrichment.
This Sigma rule simulates the lookup by hardcoding known homoglyph domains.
